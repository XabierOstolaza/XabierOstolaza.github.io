# Diseño y redacción para la web

okay! content! This is going to be an easy, breezy chapter, because as we’ve been saying all along, content isn’t really that hard to do! 

Heh. Just jokin’. But it will be a fun chapter, because now we’re going to explain how to define the content components of the content strategy quad. We’ll walk you through the decisions you’ll need to make, including:

    Substance: What content do you need and why?
    Structure: How will your content be prioritized, organized, formatted,

As you read through this (gigantic) chapter, please remember: When you make a choice about one component of the quad (like substance, for example), it very likely has impact on all three other components. Connecting the content components and people components is one of the most important roles that content strategy plays in your organization.
